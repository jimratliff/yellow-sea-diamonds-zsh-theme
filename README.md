**I‚Äôm not using Oh My Zsh anymore, so I‚Äôm archving this. You can still fork it, of course.**

See this README [on GitHub](https://github.com/jimratliff/yellow-sea-diamonds-zsh-theme/blob/main/README.md).

## Description of output and selective discussion of rationales
Here‚Äôs my theme for Zsh and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) that I developed for
my personal workflow that is characterized by:
- git
- Python 3 development
  - Consistent use of [venv virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- I am the only person working on my machine
  - Therefore I don‚Äôt need to be told who the ‚Äúuser‚Äù is
- I‚Äôm not working with multiple machines/hosts
  - Therefore I don‚Äôt need to be told the name of the machine
- I know what time it is and can‚Äôt think of any reason to have a date or time
   stamp on the prompt line (though apparently other people do have such needs)
- I work on macOS 12.4 (Monterey) using iTerm and Oh My Zsh
  - (Although I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), too, I almost always use
   [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) as the terminal app rather than VS Code‚Äôs integrated terminal)
  - This is the only environment on which Yellow Sea Diamonds has been tested
  - Will [my diamond emoji](https://symbl.cc/en/1F536/) with color
    [‚ÄúYellow Sea](https://www.htmlcsscolor.com/hex/EB9E2B)‚Äù (‚Äúüî∂‚Äù) render
    correctly and with the the same color on other people‚Äôs systems?
      - I don‚Äôt know!

This theme creates a two-line prompt structure (not including the leading blank
line to create some whitespace after the just-previous output):
- Line 1:
   - ‚Äú(venv)‚Äù (or whatever the name of your virtual environment directory)
     - The presence of this descriptor is conditional on your having an 
       activated virtual environment
     - See [¬ß¬†Usage note: Prevent duplication of the ‚Äò(venv)‚Äô virtual-environment prompt](#usage-note-prevent-duplication-of-the-venv-virtual-environment-prompt) 
     below to stop virtualenv‚Äôs own ‚Äú(venv)‚Äù 
     output from being duplicative
   - Current working directory, with ‚Äú~‚Äù replacing $HOME when possible
   - Git information (conditional on there being git information to display)
     - ‚Äú | git: ‚Äù
     - Branch name
     - Clean (‚úÖ) or Dirty (‚ùå), depending on whether there are uncommitted
       changes on your branch.
     - The SHA-1 hash of the current commit
- Line 2 (the actual prompt line):
   - Report of return code, ONLY if the return code was nonzero
     - Red box with white letters: ‚ÄúERROR #64‚Äù, where here the 64 is an example
       of a return code I encountered.
     - An easy way to test this is just to enter at the prompt:
          `sh -c 'exit 1'`
     - I rejected including a ‚úÖ or similar for a zero return code, because
       in my experience that‚Äôs not an exceptional event and so adding such 
       would create visual noise not offset by the minimal informativeness
       of the extra symbol.
   - The [Yellow Sea Diamond](https://symbl.cc/en/1F536/) prompt,
     (‚Äúüî∂‚Äù), after which this theme is named
     
Packing most of the content into the first line leaves plenty of room on 
Line 2 for commands with long arguments, particularly long file paths.

## Examples of output
### Current working directory (CWD) only‚Äîno git, no venv, no error return code

## Install Yellow Sea Diamonds
You can download this theme from its GitHub repository at:
```
https://github.com/jimratliff/yellow-sea-diamonds-zsh-theme/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```
and unzip the archive to find the Oh My Zsh theme file `yellow-sea-diamonds.zsh-theme`.

Although that is the *file* name, the theme name is simply `yellow-sea-diamonds`.

You can install Yellow Sea Diamonds in either of the following locations

```
~/.oh-my-zsh/themes
```
or
```
~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes
```
Then edit your `~/.zshrc` file and change its `ZSH_THEME` line to be:
```
ZSH_THEME="yellow-sea-diamonds"
```
Follow this up with:
```
source ~/.zshrc 
```



## Usage note: Prevent duplication of the ‚Äú(venv)‚Äù virtual-environment prompt
When you activate a venv virtual environment, virtualenv will supply its own ‚Äú(venv)‚Äù line of output. If you
don‚Äôt prevent that, this will be annoyingly duplicative of Yellow Sea Diamond‚Äôs own ‚Äú(venv)‚Äù prompt component. See
the screenshot immediately below.

<img width="879" alt="(venv)_with_duplication" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8410716/173463867-255cd7fc-3a0d-44d8-b842-0e4d8855f6d9.png">


The key to preventing this duplication is issuing the following command *before* you activate your virtual environment:
```
export VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT=1
```
(Hat tip to [icktoofay‚Äôs answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16257963/8401379) and [Marlon Richert‚Äôs answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69314224/8401379) on Stack Overflow. Also, see the [documentation for `VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/legacy/reference.html#envvar-VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT): ‚ÄúAny virtualenv *activated* when this is set to a non-empty value will leave the shell prompt unchanged during processing of the activate script, rather than modifying it to indicate the newly activated environment.‚Äù (Emphasis in original.))

See the next screenshot for this method in action:
<img width="879" alt="(venv)_without_duplication" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8410716/173463935-af8b2c22-151a-4ce7-a2a8-8430b40d7d0d.png">

Of course, you won‚Äôt want to have to remember to type this command every time you activate a virtual environment. You‚Äôll
probably find it worthwhile to [make an alias](https://linuxhint.com/configure-use-aliases-zsh/) like the following:
```
alias activate_venv='export VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT=1;source venv/bin/activate'
```
Then, after `cd`-ing into the directory in which your `venv` directory resides, just type `activate_venv` to 
simultaneously activate your virtual environment while also suppressing Zsh‚Äôs otherwise duplicative ‚Äú(venv)‚Äù output. See the next screenshot:

## Some tips for customizing Yellow Sea Diamonds, or any theme, to your liking
### Good resources to learn about customizing themes
An outstanding source to learn about customizing themes is Sarah Port, ‚Äú[Writing ZSH Themes: A Quickref](https://blog.carbonfive.com/writing-zsh-themes-a-quickref/),‚Äù CarbonFive, March 3, 2020. In particular the [Quick Reference](https://jsfiddle.net/seport/shrovLgf/embedded/result/) is amazing.

Also see:
- Armin Briegel, ‚Äú[Moving to zsh, part 6 ‚Äî Customizing the zsh Prompt](https://scriptingosx.com/2019/07/moving-to-zsh-06-customizing-the-zsh-prompt/),‚Äù Scripting OS X.
- ¬ß¬†‚Äú[Prompt Expansion](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html#Prompt-Expansion)‚Äù in
[The Z Shell Manual](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/index.html). 

### Changing colors
It‚Äôs very easy to change the color scheme of Yellow Sea Diamonds.

Yellow Sea Diamonds specifies a color by using an integer 0‚Äì255 in, for example, an `%{$FG[226]%}` command, where `FG` 
stands for ‚Äúforeground,‚Äù as opposed to `%{$BG[226]%}`, which sets the background color.

[To be honest, I have no idea what all the characters in, for example, `%{$FG[226]%}`, are doing. If they‚Äôre really necessary, somehow I‚Äôve gotten away with simple use of `$FG[226]`, as you‚Äôll see in the code for Yellow Sea Diamonds. (I‚Äôd love to be enlightened! üßê]

If you want to conveniently access the mapping between integers and colors, just use the `spectrum_ls` command, e.g.,
see the next screenshot:

<img width="474" alt="spectrum_ls_output" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8410716/173466889-6551450e-6629-4068-9f6f-60e7de5897b7.png">

After you turn on a new color with `$FG`, you‚Äôll at some point later want to reset it (so that color doesn‚Äôt take over the world) with
`%f`. To reset the background color, use `%k`. To reset both foreground and background simultaneously, you‚Äôll often
see `%{$reset_color%}`.

You can also access a handfull of colors by name, rather than number: Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan,
White. If you specify a color by name, you‚Äôll need to use the lowercase version of $FG and $BG, e.g., `$fg[red]`.
  
### Deleting a component or rearranging components
The ultimate output of Yellow Sea Diamonds, or any such theme, is the prompt structure itself.

In YSD, this is defined at the very end of the theme:
```
PROMPT="
‚ï≠‚îÄ$VIRTUALENV_REPORT $CWD $GIT_REPORT $COMMIT_HASH %{$reset_color%}
‚ï∞‚îÄ$REPORT_RETURN_CODE\$(prompt_char) "
```
I hope that the components are named so transparently that it‚Äôll be fairly obvious how to delete something you don‚Äôt
want or rearrange the components that are already there.

Each of the components is defined above the prompt structure, and they are defined in the same order that they appear
in the prompt structure (L to R, then up to down).

Of course, you can add components, too. But you‚Äôre on your own there. üòâ

### Look out for: does the commit hash continue to update automatically?
As you modify and refactor, I‚Äôd suggest that you continuously test your code.

One thing in particular to watch out for: Does the commit hash continue to update automatically? I‚Äôve had the problem
arise where a commit hash would be displayed, but then‚Äîafter I made a subsequent commit‚Äîthat hash wouldn‚Äôt change. It‚Äôs
an easy failure to miss, so I suggest‚Äîas part of your testing during development‚Äîto continuously make a new commit to
check whether its hash updates.
